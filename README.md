Arduino_Makefile_master
=======================

Use make on macos Darwin or linux instead of arduino IDE.

NOTE:
  If your sketch (.ino) does not compile because YOU did not include Arduino.h or 
  Wprogram.h then YOU need to fix YOUR code.
  YOU need to also properly do all function prototypes as well.
  Avoid problems! Do your code the proper way from the start.
